# AMUSE2021_Team_A

The following folders contain the ".csv" file of the eccentricity along time and ".amuse" files of the final stage of the core and gas particles of the Sun.<br>
- t_end={}_n={}_{}, where the last {} represents the final stage of the stellar evolution code, which is: <br>
  - 12Gyr: initally evolve the Sun to the age of 12 Gyr <br>
  - 12Gyr_moon: initally evolve the Sun to the age of 12 Gyr <br>
  - 12.05Gyr: initally evolve the Sun to the age of 12.05 Gyr <br>
  - 0.9AU: initally evolve the Sun to have a radius of 0.9 AU <br>
  - 0.9AU_no_friction: initally evolve the Sun to have a radius of 0.9 AU and neglect the friction caused by the envelope of the Sun <br>
