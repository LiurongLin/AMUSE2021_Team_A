# AMUSE2021_Team_A

The following folders contain the ".csv" file of the eccentricity, position of the Earth along time and ".amuse" files of the final stage of the core and gas particles of the Sun.<br>
- t_end={}_n={}\_{}, where the last {} represents the final stage of the stellar evolution code, which is: <br>
  - 12Gyr: initally evolve the Sun to the age of 12 Gyr <br>
  - 12Gyr_moon: initally evolve the Sun to the age of 12 Gyr with moon in the gravity system <br>
  - 12.05Gyr: initally evolve the Sun to the age of 12.05 Gyr <br>
  - 0.9AU: initally evolve the Sun to have a radius of 0.9 AU <br>
  - 0.9AU_no_friction: initally evolve the Sun to have a radius of 0.9 AU and neglect the friction caused by the envelope of the Sun <br>

<h3> plot_eccentricity_vs_t.ipynb </h3>
Use this code to make the eccentricity against time plots


<h3> coordinates_plot.ipynb </h3>
Use this code to make the trajectory of the earth after we add it into the solar system

<h3> eccentricity_vs_time </h3>
Folder that saves the eccentricity against time plots.

<h3> new_v </h3>
Folder that saves the plots of the trajectory of the Earth.
